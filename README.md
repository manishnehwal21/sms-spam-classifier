📩 SMS Spam Classifier using Machine Learning

An intelligent SMS Spam Detection System built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning that automatically classifies messages as Spam or Ham (Not Spam).

This project solves a real-world problem faced by telecom companies, banks, and users — filtering unwanted messages.

📌 Project Objective

To build an automated system that:

Detects spam messages

Blocks fraudulent SMS

Improves user security

Prevents phishing and financial fraud

🧠 How It Works

SMS messages are cleaned

Stopwords, punctuation, and noise are removed

Text is converted into numbers using TF-IDF Vectorizer

A Machine Learning model is trained

New SMS messages are classified as Spam or Ham
